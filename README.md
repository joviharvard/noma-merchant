## Project Structure
The repo was built by the general frontend web file structure conventions we use at DEV. It has react-router, apollo-client, and ThemeProvider from styled-components set up in src/App.js. It also has a full devloper environment with prettier, eslint, and travis set up.

This repository was designed first and foremost to scale to large projects. It should be easy to extend the base file structure and setup here to much larger projects.

## Set up
To install all dependecies run:
```bash
$ npm i
```
## Running
To host the website locally run:

$ npm start
